# About

A `conceptual example` which focuses on backend read and insert operations for a SQL-Server database table from a modified version of Microsoft's `NorthWind` database.

- Before running this project, create the database followed by running `SQL Scripts\script.sql`
- Why not add directly to the DataGridView new row? So to keep focus on the add operation and validation all in one method.
