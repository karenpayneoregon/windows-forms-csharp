<p>To allow a <code>calendar</code> to be displayed where the Text input is disabled other than copying we use a child form to display a month calendar to allow a date to be selected. If time is needed this can be done too but is not included. See options in my Working with time <a href="https://github.com/karenpayneoregon/WorkingWithTimeInVisualStudio/tree/master/TimeLibrary">repository</a> for a time ComboBox.</p>
<p>Decided to place the TimeComboBox under Classes folder and shown in Form2.</p>
<p>:heavy_check_mark: Written with .NET Framework 4.8 (will work in .NET Core 5), C#.</p>
<p>In the screenshot below the child form is positioned next to the button which called this form.</p>
